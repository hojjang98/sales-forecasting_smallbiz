# 🛍️ Small Business Sales Forecasting

This project aims to support small business owners by predicting sales trends  
based on transaction data, weather, calendar events, and other external variables.

Having operated a small store myself for over 1 year and 4 months,  
I understand the real-world challenges of managing unpredictable sales.  
This project is built from both practical experience and data science techniques.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict daily or weekly sales for small businesses
- Improve forecast accuracy using weather, holidays, and external events
- Visualize results to support real-world decisions (marketing, staffing, inventory)
- Demonstrate modeling skills aligned with practical business needs
