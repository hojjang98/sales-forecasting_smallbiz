when opening a specific type of store (*e.g., cafe, Korean restaurant, bakery*)  
in a particular **administrative neighborhood** (*행정동*) in Seoul.

- Help small business owners make data-informed location decisions
- Analyze past transaction data to identify **high-potential combinations**
- Lay the groundwork for building **a predictive model** based on actual trends
