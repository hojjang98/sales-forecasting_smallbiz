# 🛍️ Small Business Sales Forecasting

This project aims to support small business owners by predicting sales trends  
based on transaction data, weather, calendar events, and other external variables.

Having operated a small store myself for over 1 year and 4 months,  
I understand the real-world challenges of managing unpredictable sales.  
This project is built from both practical experience and data science techniques.
